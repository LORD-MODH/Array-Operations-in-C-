# Array Operations Program

This program is a simple C++ console application that performs various operations on an array of integers. The user can create an array, insert elements, delete elements, search for elements, and display the contents of the array.

## Features
**Create**: Create an array with user-defined elements. 

**Insert**: Insert an element at a specified position. 

**Delete**: Delete an element at a specified position. 

**Display**: Display the elements in the array. 

**Search**: Search for an element in the array. 
## Usage
Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled executable file.
The program will display a menu with options for performing different array operations.
Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.
Follow the prompts to perform the desired operation.
The program will continue to display the menu until the user chooses to exit by entering 6.
